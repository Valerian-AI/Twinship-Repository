Node.js installed

Git installed
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
cd YourRepositoryName

3. Install Dependencies

Bash

npm install
4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named .env in the root of the project.

Get your connection string from your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

Add the connection string to your .env file. Remember to replace <password> with your actual database user password.

DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://YourUser:YourPassword@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority
5. Run the Server

Bash

node server.js
The application will be running at http://localhost:3000.

File Structure
The project is organized into a standard Node.js application structure.

Usage
Admin Mode
To access the content management features, add ?admin=true to the end of the URL.

Example: http://localhost:3000?admin=true

This will reveal the admin tools panel, edit icons, and delete/drag handles on content.

Music Library
To add songs to the library, simply place your .mp3 files and their corresponding .jpg or .png cover art (with the exact same filename) into the /public/uploads/music folder using the admin music uploader. The server will automatically detect them on the next page load.

Deployment
This application is ready for deployment on services like Render.

Push the final code to a GitHub repository.

Create a new "Web Service" on Render and connect it to your repository.

Use the following settings:

Build Command: npm install

Start Command: node server.js

In the "Environment" tab, add a secret environment variable with the Key DATABASE_URL and the Value being your full MongoDB Atlas connection string.

Render will automatically deploy the application on every push to your main branch.
